    "Weapon": "Catalyst",
    "Element": "Hydro",
    "Birthday": "July 5th",
    "Constellation": "Crater",
    "Nation": "Mondstadt",
    "Affiliation": "Church of Favonius",
    "SpecialDish": "Spicy Stew",
    "Titles": "Shining Idol, Deaconess",
    "Intro": "Barbara is the deaconess of the Church of Favonius and a self-proclaimed \"idol\" after learning about them from the intrepid adventurer Alice.\n",
    "Introduction": "The Deaconess of the Favonius Church and a shining starlet adored by all. Although the concept of a starlet is rather novel in a city of bards, the people of Mondstadt love Barbara nonetheless. \"I owe everything to the city's spirit of freedom\" — Barbara, regarding her popularity.",
    "Personality": [
        "Every citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara. However, she learned the word \"idol\" from a magazine.",
        "Barbara is a charismatic individual who does her best to spread joy all around. The mere sight of her alone can boost people's spirits.",
        "She has been bright and optimistic from a young age, albeit being a bit clumsy at times. Regardless, she's able to quickly recover and jump back into it.",
        "Barbara is a hard-worker, but can be hard on herself at times. However successful she may seem to others, she shares her own mixed feelings on her achievements. Barbara will become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful when pondering about how long a smile lasts on someone's face after listening to her song.",
        "Barbara has a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to her older sister, wanting to surpass her in at least one thing, be it popularity or grades. Even now, she continues to repress these feelings. Regardless, she unconditionally loves her just as much.",
        "Being the deaconess for the Church, Barbara takes the safekeeping of religious artefacts seriously. After seeing the damaged Holy Lyre der Himmel, she flew into a panic, and refused to let anyone see it after the Stormterror incident. Likewise, Dainsleif suggests that if she learned of the fate of the missing statue, she would likely have asked the Knights to reclaim it for the Church.",
        "Her craving for recognition switched over into the mere desire to help people. Even with all her depressing thoughts, she quickly jumps back on her feet, not allowing herself to be depressed for more than 30 seconds. Barbara continues to strive for excellence, believing she'll be of help to her sister.",
        "Despite her appearance and personality, Barbara has an unusual liking to spicy food and drinks as it keeps her awake and working to the best of her abilities. She dislikes bitter foods."
    ],
    "Appearance": [
        "Barbara has a small, petite build with ash blonde hair, tied in pigtails, and blue eyes.",
        "She wears a white frock that is open at the shoulders with blue frills, gold lining, and a large white and blue bow, with a gold cross, in the front, along with white tights, black flats with block heels, and a blue and white cap resembling a nurse's cap with a gold cross on its front. Her white tights have a faint flower polka-dot pattern, and her flats have blue cuffs attached above her ankles.",
        "Her Vision is attached to a gold-adorned spell-book with a light blue cover and a small cross charm hangs at her side, attached to a black strap held together with a gold hoop."
