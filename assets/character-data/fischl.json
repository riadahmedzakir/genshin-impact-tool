    "Sex": "Female",
    "Weapon": "Bow",
    "Element": "Electro",
    "Birthday": "May 27th",
    "Constellation": "Corvus",
    "Nation": "Mondstadt",
    "Affiliation": "Adventurers' Guild",
    "SpecialDish": "Die Heilige Sinfonie",
    "Titles": "Prinzessin der Verurteilung, Ruler of the Ashen Darkness, Mein Fräulein (by Oz), Sovereign of Immernachtreich",
    "Intro": "Fischl is an investigator for Mondstadt's Adventurers' Guild, accompanied by the night raven Oz. Fischl claims to hail from a world beyond Teyvat. She is a daring adventurer with seemly outlandish theories that happen to turn out to be true.\n",
    "Introduction": "A mysterious girl who calls herself \"Prinzessin der Verurteilung\" and travels with a night raven named Oz. Currently serves as an investigator in the Adventurers' Guild. Through her unique abilities, eccentric character, and (while she would never admit it herself) hard work, Fischl has become a rising star among the Adventurers' Guild's investigators, earning the recognition of all.",
    "Personality": [
        "A mysterious girl who calls herself \"Prinzessin der Verurteilung\" and travels with a night raven named Oz.",
        "Due to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. Her speaking manner can confuse those unfamiliar with her, which results in Oz having to translate to whoever she is speaking with to understand what she means. She is used to talking this way that even breaking character confuses them just as much. Most people generally shun her for her childish behavior, making Fischl upset, but it does not dismay her. She appreciates company that is willing to go along with her roleplaying, as she has very few friends.",
        "Fischl also has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurer's Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish (such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse), Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen."
    ],
    "Appearance": [
        "Fischl has blonde hair, light green eyes, and a petite build with fair skin. Two sections of her hair are tied into twin tails with a black ribbon, the left of which is decorated with a bat wing pattern. Fischl wears a black eyepatch that is worn to not obstruct her view when possessing Oz.",
        "Overall, Fischl seems to have designed her outfit to be as asymmetrical as physically possible. She wears a sleeveless black lace dress-like leotard with a black lace collar and purple bow tie, crosses stitched in, and black and violet tailcoats. Fischl's vision is tied to the back of this dress with a bat wing-style purple ribbon. She wears a shoulder-length black glove on her left hand and a black and purple sleeve on her right arm. Fischl wears a transparent black stocking on her right leg and a similar thigh-high black sock held up by a garter on her left. Fischl wears black boots with a light purple lining, gold heels, and bat wing decorations.",
        "In general, Fischl seems to style herself after the titular character of the book \"Flowers for Princess Fischl.\""
