It can only be a sword.If nothing else, it shall bear the memory of those who faced their ends without fear...When you wield this sword, you search for the answers hidden within this world.In this world, such a weapon may be used without any problem.Not for the fact that the universe casts no shadows here, and certainly not simply because it suits this world's aesthetics...But because this search is perhaps why you descended to this realm in the first place.When the past is dust, and the future arrives,As the present fades away, you can trust to this blade's edge.Having a weapon for self-defense is, of course, a good idea. After all, this one was forged for one such as yourself.Someone who challenges and pursues.Take it, walk this earth,And cut open all the challenges and mysteries that it has to offer you."
