    "Story": " A nimble sword with holes and delicate engravings on the blade.The sword once made the sound of a flute when wielded by one with the requisite skill. The pitch and tone were determined by the swinging angle.This sword was buried when the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded. Unearthed years later, it has long since lost its ability to sing.Even so, it still makes a lethal weapon.Among the members of the Wanderer's Troupe was a valiant sword-wielding dancer.After the Troupe's attempt to tear down the ruling class failed, she was enslaved as a gladiator.Though all her hope and all her companions were lost, still she fought bravely.Her sword sang with the radiance of the morn's light, and she was dubbed the \"Dawnlight Swordswoman.\"In his youth, the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr was in the retinue of a knight.He went with his master to watch a gladiator match, and was moved by the Dawnlight Swordswoman's splendid finale.He named himself the Dawn Knight in her honor, and knew in his heart what he must do next."
