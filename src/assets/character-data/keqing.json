    "Sex": "Female",
    "Birthday": "November 20th",
    "Weapon": "Sword",
    "Element": "Electro",
    "Constellation": "Trulla Cementarii",
    "Nation": "Liyue",
    "Affiliation": "Liyue Qixing",
    "SpecialDish": "Survival Grilled Fish",
    "Titles": "Driving Thunder, Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing",
    "Intro": "Keqing is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. She is someone who seeks her own answers instead of idly letting chaos run amok in Liyue. Keqing chooses her own path with her own power and ability, instead of letting the gods determine her fate.",
    "Introduction": "The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠— but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.She firmly believes that humanity's future should be determined by humans themselves, and that they can even do better than the archons and adepti have done for them. In order to prove this, she works harder than anyone else.",
    "Personality": [
        "The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue — but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.",
        "One of the Liyue Qixing, Keqing has an uncompromising belief in actions over words. If she sees something that needs doing, she'll do it herself. For example, she traveled around Liyue and carefully memorized each detail of the land so that she may one day be able to maximize the utility of every last inch of Liyue.",
        "Keqing deals with the day-to-day affairs of Liyue, whether great or small, while Rex Lapis only descends once a year. To many, the millennia of prosperity that Liyue has enjoyed serve to legitimize Rex Lapis' guidance of the city. But Keqing has her reservations about all this, viewing Liyue's present prosperity as akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.",
        "Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?",
        "It is this unanswered question that drives Keqing to work relentlessly and remain diligent. From most people's perspective, there is no point in working oneself up like this. But Keqing cannot sit by idly and ignore this hidden danger.",
        "The people of Liyue have never considered navigating the future on their own terms. But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and forge a new path with their own hands.",
        "Keqing is a workaholic, demanding herself to work \"ten times harder than the average human\". She also has a strong sense of responsibility and will not stop until a task has been completed perfectly - and by her standards, that means everything related to that task is also resolved. Before Rex Lapis' departure from Liyue, Keqing was an adamant skeptic of the gods and of Visions, believing that humans should deal with human affairs. However, once the Qixing took on the former responsibilities of Rex Lapis, she gained new respect for him after realizing how much he had done for Liyue. She now keeps a collection of Rex Lapis memorabilia in the name of 'self-reflection'.",
        "Outside of work, she enjoys shopping when she has the time to do so, and her favorite food is Golden Shrimp Balls."

    "Appearance": [
        "Keqing has fair skin and dark amethyst eyes, with oval cat-like pupils featuring diamond-shaped markings on the iris. Her light purple hair tied into waist-length twin-tails, topped by small odango-style buns resembling cat ears. There is also a small braid running along the side of her bangs.",
        "She wears a pale lavender top with a high violet collar and ruffled dark blue skirt, layered under a deep violet overcoat. The opening of her overcoat is marked by a golden ornament, which has white flowers and purple and gold-accented feathers attached. The pattern of the feathers resembles the ones on the dangling backs of her long sleeves. In addition, she wears a golden hairpin, a tasseled choker, and dark gloves with lavender trim."
