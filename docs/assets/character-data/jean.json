Due to this, Jean often exhausts herself trying to complete commissions from the locals, much to the concern of her fellow members.",
        "Her devotion to her duties stems from two reasons; her upbringing as a child, and Varka's teachings. Even though he consistently takes his duties lightly, his relaxed and unruly personality has contributed to her growth. She shows no resentment towards his attitude, instead vowing to ensure that the city will be more prosperous and welcoming when he returns. Her work ethic makes her well-liked by both Mondstadt's citizens, her fellow members, and is noted by other organizations. Although she prefers using peaceful methods to solve problems, she will not hesitate to use force if necessary.",

Whenever she feels troubled or confused, she often heads to the Great Tree in Windrise.<ref>Barbara's dialogue in Master's Day Off",
        "She has a habit of calling Diluc her senior, even well after he left the Knights. Despite this, she acknowledges that they both share the same vision of protecting Mondstadt."
