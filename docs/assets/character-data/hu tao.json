    "Intro": "She is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.",
    "Introduction": "Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a person vital to managing Liyue's funerary affairs.She does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserve the world's balance of yin and yang.Aside from this, she is also a talented poet whose many \"masterpieces\" have passed around Liyue's populace by word of mouth.",
    "Personality": [
        "The 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. She took over the business at a rather young age.",
        "It would be best not underestimate someone as whimsical as her. However, should you enjoy surprises, then I believe a visit is in order.",
        "At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. No one would think that she is actually the renowned director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor unless she tells them or they are working with her.",
        "Hu Tao enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Due to her eccentric and off the wall personality, many people who interact with Hu Tao are generally left a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that Hu Tao has a \"punchable face\" and should be stored in the fridge. On the contrary, Xiao likes her humor and finds it interesting.",
        "Despite her negative impressions, she is also shown to be quite intelligent, being suspicious of Zhongli's true identity and knowing a fair amount about Liyue's hidden secrets and past. Despite always teasing him for being old-fashioned, Zhongli is also the friend and subordinate whom she trusts most.",
        "She is quite secretive with sensitive information, as she refuses to disclose it claiming that the less outsiders know about it, the safer they are. She also takes pride in the parlor's storied history and her position as its current director, although she dislikes how others treat her and her employees with suspicion when they go out at night to work.",
        "Hu Tao accepts death as a natural part of life; while this may make her appear callous to others, it helps her truly respect her job to help the dead \"cross over\". For this reason, Hu Tao viewed Qiqi's zombie state as unnatural and wished to bury the zombie so that she could pass on properly, and dislikes Baizhu after realizing that he is seeking out ways to prolong his life. She also appears to show a lack of interest in her Pyro Vision."

    "Appearance": [
        "Hu Tao has fair skin and scarlet eyes with flower-shaped pupils. She has long, dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips, which she keeps parted into twin ponytails. She wears a dark brown porkpie hat decorated with red plum blossoms and branches, along with an indigo tassel and a wooden talisman attached to the front.",
        "Hu Tao wears a traditional red shirt with a mandarin collar and black shorts with gold accents under a dark coat. Her Pyro Vision is embedded at the back of her coat, along with long rectangular coattails, a black collar and cuffs, and golden brooches attached underneath her coat's collar and waist. In addition, Hu Tao wears a pair of white socks with matching red blossoms along with low heeled dress shoes."
