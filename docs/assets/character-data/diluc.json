    "Introduction": "As the wealthiest gentleman in Mondstadt, the ever-dapper Diluc always presents himself as the epitome of perfection. But behind the courteous visage burns a zealous soul that has sworn to protect Mondstadt at all costs, allowing him to mercilessly vanquish all who threaten his city.",
    "Personality": [
        "The tycoon of a winery empire in Mondstadt, unmatched in every possible way",
        "Kaeya calls himself and Diluc \"anti-heroes with attitude problems.\" Diluc was once an ideal young man, dedicated to his work with Knights of Favonius. When he was a member of the Knights, he adored his father, Crepus. But after his father's untimely death, Diluc grew aloof, bitter, and distant in part due to Inspector Eroch's mishandling of the case. Even after Eroch was discharged as a traitor, Diluc retained his resentment for the Knights, claiming that they are too complacent. Believing them to be unfit for the job, he became a vigilante known as the \"Darknight Hero\" to protect the people of Mondstadt.",
        "Despite his complicated emotions towards the Knights, Diluc believes that both Lisa and Jean are some of their better members. He still respects them for all the work they do for the people. He has a bitter words but is a gentle and considerate nature.",
        "Diluc is not fond of alcohol, stating that he doesn't like its taste, instead preferring grape juice. This does not appear to be well known by many however, most likely as a result of him being the current owner of Mondstadt's largest wine producer. He even expresses surprise when he learns that Diona also loathes alcohol, having initially believed that he was the only bartender in Mondstadt that did not like alcohol. And as he tends to part with his possessions, he sold father's private residence."

        "Diluc wears a black shirt, a long white vest, and a black ascot with a red gem. Over this he dons a dark brown coat that is adorned with golden trimmings and tassels, ending with black fur-trims. He wears black pants which are embellished with chains on his right thigh; while his Vision, attached to a belt, is settled upon his left thigh, along with cuffed, dark brown boots held by multiple buckles. Diluc also wears gloves, which are black with crimson red undersides. Around his neck is a wide black tie pinned by a red brooch."
