        "Ningguang is a professional businesswoman, having accumulated her wealth through hard work and perseverance. Zhongli recalls her selling her wares at Yaoguang Shoal barefooted, and considers her to be a rare gem as she always presses on regardless of the situation. She has a very refined business wit, making use of a massive intelligence network and pawns to outplay her competition, although she makes sure she knows of their weaknesses before doing so. She appears to be motivated by sole interest of making mora, which often makes others have a negative view of her. Being the Tianquan of the Liyue, Ningguang is also devoted to Liyue's safety as she maintains law and order.",
