    "Intro": "The mysterious Albedo is the Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius through a recommendation from the adventurer Alice, with Sucrose as his assistant. He holds an infinite desire to learn about the world of Teyvat, carefully studying every object around him.\n",
    "Introduction": "Albedo — an alchemist based in Mondstadt, in the service of the Knights of Favonius.\"Genius,\" \"Kreideprinz,\" or \"Captain of the Investigation Team\"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire — acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.",
    "Personality": [
        "A genius known as the Kreideprinz, he is the Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius.",
        "Albedo is described as an amiable and popular figure in Mondstadt, as well as an alchemical genius. He pursues the \"truth\" of the world of Teyvat per his master's request and seems to be able to create living organisms through his alchemical talents. Albedo is also apparently good with children, as even the rambunctious Klee listens to him, and he sees her like a younger sister of sorts.",
        "Similarly to Sucrose, Albedo spends most of his time as a recluse that he shows a slight distaste for talking with others because of the trouble needed to maintain the social relationship. He does not stutter like his assistant.",
        "Albedo is a talented artist, having picked up the hobby initially to help with his experiments, but now does so to relax. He serves as Xingqiu's illustrator, considering him to be a good author. He researches and studies whatever he is interested in, stating that he enjoys the sense of enlightenment doing so. Once this feeling is gone, he quickly abandons what he was doing as the truth feels bittersweet to him. He also retains this habit when it comes to eating.",
        "Despite being seen in a positive manner by the people of Mondstadt, they know almost nothing about him, and he is secretive about his past. He is implied to be a homunculus created by his master, as he curiously sees her as his creator and considers himself to be different from the people of Teyvat. Due to the forgotten and ancient knowledge he possesses, he even considers himself to be a threat, with both Venti and Dainsleif considering him to be dangerous for that reason."

    "Appearance": [
        "Albedo is a young man with bright teal eyes with three dots in his iris (similar to the alchemy table) and pale skin. He has ashy light blonde hair reaching below his shoulders, partially pulled back in a braided ponytail. He is around the same age as Sucrose.",
        "Albedo wears a long white coat with short sleeves, a black hood, black and gold details, a golden chain, and lining. Under this, he wears an indigo shirt and a pair of black shorts, along with plain black stockings, embellished thigh-high black boots with silver accents, and long black gloves with orange undersides and gold details, and also has a diamond-shaped gold marking on his neck and wears his vision on the collar of his shirt right below it."
